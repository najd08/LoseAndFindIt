# LoseAndFindIt
The Lose&amp;FindIt  project is a campus-based platform that helps community members locate misplaced items. Users can post detailed descriptions of lost belongings, while others can contribute by sharing relevant information or sightings. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of unity and support within the campus community.
